# Opioid Adulterant Potency Prediction

## Introduction

This application predicts the potency of opioid adulterants based on their EC50 values. Understanding the potency of these substances is crucial for public health and safety. The application uses interpolation to provide predictions and visualizes the data for better understanding.

## Overview

The application consists of a web interface built using Streamlit. Users can upload a CSV file containing data on various opioid adulterants, and the application will:
1. Display the uploaded data.
2. Plot EC50 vs Potency.
3. Allow users to input an EC50 value to predict the corresponding potency using interpolation.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Users can upload a CSV file containing the data.
- **Data Preview**: The application displays the first few rows of the uploaded data.
- **Visualization**: A plot of EC50 vs Potency with an interpolation line for predictions.
- **Prediction**: Users can input an EC50 value to get the predicted potency.
